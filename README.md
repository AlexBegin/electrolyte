# Electrolyte


Electrolyte is a simple, lightweight [inversion of control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control)
(IoC) container for Node.js applications.

Electrolyte automatically wires together the various components and services
needed by an application.  It does this using a technique known as
[dependency injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) (DI).
Using Electrolyte eliminates boilerplate code and improves software quality by
encouraging loose coupling between modules, resulting in greater reusability and
increased test coverage.

For further details about the software architecture used for IoC and dependency
injection, refer to [Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection pattern](http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html)
by [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/).
